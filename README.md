## Supported Versions ðŸŒˆ

* GTA San Andreas - v1.00

Other versions of the game *will not* work and will most likely cause a crash.

Check this link if you wish to downgrade a later version to a compatible version - https://dl1.rockstarnexus.com/gta/sa/GTASA_12-9-14_Steam_to_V1_DG.exe

## Installation ðŸŒˆ

[Tutorial by SpeedyFolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRz_zTuctKc)

Installation requires an ASI Loader to be installed.

[Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) by [ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG) is a popular option since it supports CrashDumps, which will be necessary if you want to report a crash.

If you already have mods like CLEO, you probably already have an ASI Loader installed. 

1. To install the Ultimate ASI Loader, simply extract the Ultimate ASI Loader's dinput8.dll file to the game's root directory (Folder where the game is installed).
2. To install Rainbomizer, download the release archive from [Releases](https://github.com/Parik27/Rainbomizer/releases) and extract the archive to the root directory.

## Configuration ðŸŒˆ

If you wish to change any of the mod's functionalities, for example to disable a specific randomizer, a configuration file (`config.toml`) has been provided with the mod. The config file is located in the `rainbomizer` folder in the game's root directory.

The default configuration file is in the main repository, `config.toml`, and is automatically created by the mod if it doesn't exist in the rainbomizer folder.

The configuration file is in the TOML format. It is similar in structure to INI's, but with a defined and better structure. It can be opened and edited with a basic text editor such as Notepad++.

To configure a specific randomizer, search for its name in the section listing all of the Randomizers at the top of the file. You can set the "Enabled" key to 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable it respectively.

Many randomizers allow you to further customise how each individual randomizer works via further sub-options as you proceed through the file. These options can allow you to enable or disable certain things about each randomizer, increase or decrease odds of specific things happening, or force something specific to always happen, such as a certain mission or vehicle spawn.

Please note that randomizers listed under the `Experimental` section are disabled by default as they are not thoroughly tested and are known to cause crashes and / or softlocks. Enable such options at your own discretion.

More information about how to configure each specific randomizer option is provided in the default config file.

## Mod Support ðŸŒˆ

This mod features full compatibility with all of the effects in the [GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/Trilogy-ASI-Script) by [Lordmau5](https://github.com/Lordmau5) for those who wish to use the two mods together. As they are often combined, we made an effort to make sure it was supported by the Rainbomizer.

The mod also supports the [Design Your Own Mission mod](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=5038) as shown by the DYOM Randomizer - all randomizers are compatible except for Language Randomizer which is recommended to be disabled.

Please note that compatibility with other mods not mentioned here is not guaranteed, and we recommend removing them if you are having frequent crashes or other issues, or else disabling randomizers which you think may not be functional with them. However, minor mods such as those that modify a vehicle's appearance are likely to work.
