## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ðŸŒˆ

If you have questions about the mod or other issues installing the mod or getting it to work, check if your query is responded to here. Otherwise, you can ask for help in the [Rainbomizer Discord server](https://discord.gg/BYVBQw7).

#### When I try to start the game, I get a warning message about an ASI error and/or the file gets deleted and the game plays without any changes.
This means you have an anti-virus that is blocking the mod from functioning. Either add an exception for the SA.Rainbomizer.ASI or disable your anti-virus when playing.

#### The Mission Randomizer is enabled but missions aren't random or they don't pass properly upon completion.
This most likely means that you do not have the correct main.scm file. [Click here to download a main.scm supported by the mod](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/681997113751502870/695376713651322980/main.scm). Make a backup of your existing file and place the new one in the data/scripts folder of your game installation.

#### The game is crashing after I activated Experimental Randomizers (such as Particles, Weapon Stats, or Objects).
As noted above, the experimental randomizers are not fully functional and are known to crash or otherwise softlock the game. If you want the smoothest experience, these should all be disabled, and are just there for you to have fun experimenting with if you wish to, but are not suited to a full playthrough.

#### I'm having other trouble installing the mod.
First you should re-check that you've followed all your steps. Is your game downgraded to V1? If our provided downgrader doesn't work for you, you may wish to find an alternative. Did you download the Ultimate ASI Loader? If so, make sure you did not install the x64 version. If you already have a dinput8.dll file in your SA directory such as for a mouse fix, you can rename the ASI Loader to an alternative such as vorbisFile.dll or d3d8.dll. Again, make sure your anti-viruses and/or Windows Defender are not blocking the mod. If none of this works for you, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/BYVBQw7) and ask for help in the #support channel.

#### How does the Mission Randomizer work exactly?
All of the missions are started at the usual markers that'd start at, such as first marker being the one at Grove Street for Big Smoke. However, the mission the marker starts will be randomized to a different mission that you must complete. This mission will always be the same if `RandomizeOnce` is enabled and will change each time you start it if not. Each marker has a different random mission linked to it which is determined by a seed that the mod randomly generates or one that you set yourself in the config file. During the course of the random mission, the cities unlocked will correspond to those that are normally unlocked during that mission, and will revert back if you fail or pass. Upon completing the mission, you will be teleported back to where you would have ended the mission that normally started at the marker you originally entered, and the game will progress as if you completed the original mission, meaning completing a randomized mission in place of Big Smoke still unlocks The Johnson House and the next mission (Ryder).

#### How does the Ped Randomizer work exactly? How do I know who's a gang member?
The Ped Randomizer randomizes only the pedestrian's model, which is what they look like. In every other sense, they behave the same as their original model. So while cops for example will look different, they will still chase after you and attempt to bust you if you commit crimes. Gang members have distinguishing characteristics that make them identifiable even when randomized, such as they tend to hang out in groups and they smoke and can carry beer bottles. Enemy gangs will still be antagonised towards you and trigger gang wars when killed, and you can still recruit Grove Street members - they will simply look like different people. When using keyboard and mouse, you can identify if a gang member is friendly or not by aiming at them and seeing if the arrow above their head is pointing up or down. If you dislike randomized gang members or cops, both can be specifically disabled in the config section for Ped Randomizer.

#### Will random mission vehicles work with mods that add new missions?
Yes. A system has been implemented where if the currently running script is not one from the original game, the Script Vehicle Randomizer will default to a set of generic patterns guaranteeing the same type of vehicle and number of seats in order ensure compatibility with many different types of mods, even those that may completely change the game's story or add entirely new missions. A notable example is Design Your Own Mission - these generic patterns are used for any custom mission you may play and so should allow you to complete any kind of mission.

#### Can I make it so that the models in cutscenes don't have those broken jaws?
Yes, scroll down to the section for CutsceneRandomizer and set `UseOnlyNormalCutsceneModels` to true. Every ped model is included by default for fun and variety, but only certain models designed for cutscenes can use proper facial animations which is why this occurs.

#### When I play with Parked Car Randomizer, boats and planes spawn as cars - can I force them to be normal boats or planes?
Yes. Set `RandomizeToSameType` to true in the config under ParkedCarRandomizer and this will ensure randomized fixed spawns always become another vehicle of that type, guaranteeing some kind of random boat at locations for boats and planes in airports.

#### Can I tone down the amount of colour in Colour Randomizer?
Yes, Colour Randomizer has many settings in the config to adjust the amount of things randomized. `UseMinimalistTextRandomization` is ideal if you'd like less colour on the HUD. You can also disable `RandomizeWeaponSprites` if you don't like the coloured weapon icon. There are also settings for disabling random colours for lights and stars, or if you'd like less variation in light colours but still want random lights, use `ConsistentLights`. There are also other settings that are disabled by default due to being too unpleasant to look at, but you can try them out if you wish. We offer a lot of customisation for you to try out different things.

#### Why does the Language Randomizer constantly change some text?
This effect is most prevalent in the main menu, so if you find it to be too much there, it likely will not have as much impact for you during gameplay. This is part of a setting in the config - the text will change somewhere between every 1 and 5 seconds by default. If you want to make this longer, increase these values in the config to any whole number you'd like to use.

#### I don't like [feature] and want to disable it.
There is a high chance that anything you want to disable or change can be using the config file. See the Configuration section in the main ReadMe. If there is something you want to change and you don't see it there, you can give us feedback about it on the [Rainbomizer Discord](https://discord.gg/BYVBQw7).

#### Can I use this mod with the Chaos Mod?
Yes, they are fully compatible together and every effect works with every stable randomizer. See the Mod Support section in the main ReadMe.

#### Can I use this mod with other types of mods?
We cannot guarantee compatibility with any other mods, but most that are not Total Conversions should be stable, however if you have frequent crashes or other issues, it is most likely another mod you are combining with the Rainbomizer making it unstable. Total Conversion mods most likely will not function very well as the mod is primarily made for the normal game, however certain randomizers may still work. See the Mod Support section in the main ReadMe.
